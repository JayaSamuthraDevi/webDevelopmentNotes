What is HTTP?

HTTP is a protocol, or a definite set of rules, for accessing resources on the web. Resources could mean anything from HTML files to data from a database, photos, text, and so on.

These resources are made available to us via an API and we make requests to these APIs via the HTTP protocol. 

The Anatomy of an HTTP Request

An HTTP request must have the following:

    An HTTP method (like GET)
    A host URL (like https://api.spotify.com/)
    An endpoint path(like  v1/artists/{id}/related-artists)
