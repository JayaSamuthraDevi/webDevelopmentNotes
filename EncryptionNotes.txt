Encryption:

Encryption is the process of protecting information or data by using mathematical models to scramble it in such a way that only the parties who have the key to unscramble it can access it. 

How encryption works?
plaintext is converted into ciphertext by cryptographic mathematical models known as algorithms.
to decode it ,use decryption key

Types of encryption:
*Symmetric encryption--known as shared key or private key algorithm, uses the same key for encryption and decryption.
*Asymmetric encryption--known as public-key cryptography, uses two separate keys to encrypt and decrypt data

Common encryption algorithms::
* Data Encryption Standard (DES)
* Triple DES (3DES) 
* Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 
* Twofish
The most common methods of asymmetric encryption include:
* RSA(Rivest-Shamir-Adelman)
* Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) 

Encryption performs four important functions:

    *Confidentiality: keeps the contents of the data secret
    *Integrity: verifies the origin of the message or data
    *Authentication: validates that the content of the message or data has not been altered since it was sent
    *Nonrepudiation: prevents the sender of the data or message from denying they were the origin
    
Advantages of encryption:
*Protects data across devices
*Ensures data integrity
*Protects digital transformations

Disadvantages of encryption:
*Ransomware
*Key management
