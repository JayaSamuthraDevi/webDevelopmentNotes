Hashing:

Hashing means using some function or algorithm to map object data to some representative integer value.

hash code narrow down our search in finding item in map.
hash code generates an index at which value is stored.

In hash tables, you store data in forms of key and value pairs.
(value is given as an input to hash function,it generates a hash code (integer) where the value is mapped.)

Collision Handling

   * Separate Chaining--by creating linked list 
   * Open Addressing	
	-Linear Probing--storing in value in next hashcode number
    	-Quadratic Probing--storing in value in after 2 hashcode number
   	- Double Hashing--using two hash function
